				<a href="https://www.worldsadrift.com/">World's Adrift</a> was a game made by Bossa Studios that shut down in mid-2019. It was a presistent open world game where you got to build ships, explore upon them, and find out the lore of the world you are in. It was persistent in the sense that if you were to crash your ship (or someone else's), it would stay there, forever, eventually rusting away or until another player comes along to turn it into scraps for themselves.
			</p>
			<p>I loved every aspect of this game. The shipbuilder was 3D hologram preview and you could edit the points to change the size and shape precisely to how you wanted it. It had the single best grapple hook mechanic I have experienced in any game. You could swing around corners and get the rope hooked onto things. If you were to circle a pillar or a column it would eventually get coiled around it. Holding rightclick and seeing your hand point to where you were going to hook onto mere moments before hitting the ground was endless fun. Even jumping off your ship amidst the void to just narrowly grab your enemies ship, to pull yourself aboard and lay siege.</p>
			<p>I stuck with this game from alpha, to it's closure, however I still regret not playing it enough. And when it closed in june of 2019, I was heartbroken, because I knew there would never be another game like it.</p>

				<p>I wanted to change that fact, I could not let a game like this just come and go as do others things in life. I am definitively not the best game developper by any means (haven't touched my other game since may of 2020), but I set out to try and recreate it myself, solo. Along the way I have encountered (and will continue to encounter) unique challenges that test my skills as a programmer, and help me improve. And I hope this blog will serve to keep me in check and continue to work on this project regardless of the obstacles up ahead. I will try to keep this updated as best as I can (no promises :)).</p>

			<p>
				When Siege came out, it got the usual Ubisoft treatment. Over-hype the graphics and gameplay at E3 and in trailers, and don't deliver. However something special happened, they realized their mistakes. Over the past 5 years, it went from another FPS title, to one of the biggest Esports titles in the world.
				<br>
				<br>
				This is a game I have been playing ever since 2017, operation White Noise. And it has kept me coming back (1000 hours ingame), because of the constant addition of new content, the reachability of the devs and sense of community. But most importantly to me, Siege is a game that rewards you for using your head, which will always prevent stale gameplay. The name "Chess with guns" is thrown around for siege, and I honestly think this is an excellent analogy. Popular figures such as CoconutBrah would agree with me. He's said himself he was never really good at aiming and mechanical ability in videogames, but siege allowed him to excel despite this. 
				<br>
				<br>
				This game has managed to not only survive, but thrive on it's entirely unique gameplay. Destructible walls and floors allowing you to make your own sightlines, special gadgets for each and every (at the time of writing) 52 operators. This is a game that I can sink hours into, and not one game plays the same. If you get this game (and I hope you do), you will truly be rewarded for the time that you will put in. In essence, you reap what you sow.
				<br>
				<br>
				However, there are things that I would like to address, and that's bug fixing. It does really take Ubi long time to fix certain things, while some things are left unfixed for the time being (falling in this game needs a whole revamp in my opinion). But what the upcoming Operation Steel Wave shows us, is that they are trying to fix things, albeit at their own pace and they have not abandoned this game.
				<br>
				<br>
				I hope this review convinced you to get game, and if you do, please, please don't be an Ash main.
